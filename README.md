### Hello!
My name is **Kevin Renskers**.

I'm a creative freelance developer with a passion for good design and intuitive, user friendly interfaces. I love working on the front end, whether that's creating a beautiful and performant iOS app or using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and responsive web apps. I also like working on the back end: I use Swift, Python, Node.js and Firestore to create developer-friendly APIs for those apps.

Usability and design are always on my mind, even when writing code: this should be usable, readable and beautiful too.

I've been online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. You can find my open source projects on [loopwerk.io/projects](https://www.loopwerk.io/projects/) and a portfolio of mobile apps I've created on [loopwerk.io/apps](https://www.loopwerk.io/apps/).
