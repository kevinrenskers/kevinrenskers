### Hello!
My name is **Kevin Renskers**.

Iâ€™m a creative developer with a passion for good usability and great design. I love working on intuitive, user friendly interfaces, especially on the "back-of-the-front-end" side of things; I love making stuff tick, architecting innovative solutions to complex problems. I also love working on the back-end: I use Python (with Django REST Framework or Django Ninja), or Swift (with Vapor), to create developer-friendly APIs for those apps.

Usability and design are always on my mind, even when writing code: this should be usable, readable and beautiful too.

I've been online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. Explore my open source projects at www.loopwerk.io/projects and view my app portfolio at www.loopwerk.io/apps. My CV can be found on www.loopwerk.io/about.
