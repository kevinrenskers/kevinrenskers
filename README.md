### Hi there!

My name is Kevin Renskers, and I’m a creative software developer with a passion for good usability and great design. I love working on intuitive, user friendly interfaces and their APIs.

I created my first website in 2000 and my first iOS app in 2010. I’ve been working as a fully remote freelance developer since 2016, fixing projects for international clients such as CBS, Last.fm, Sentry, WeTransfer and Unilever. I’ve mentored multiple junior developers, both at other companies and in my own [mentorship program](https://www.loopwerk.io/mentor/).

You can expect a healthy dose of Dutch honesty from me. I’ll just tell you how it is, what needs to be fixed, without the bullshit. I think our industry could use some more honesty and better ethics.

Explore my open source projects at www.loopwerk.io/projects and view my app portfolio at www.loopwerk.io/apps. My CV can be found on www.loopwerk.io/about.
